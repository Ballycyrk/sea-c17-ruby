# What if Grandma doesnâ€™t want you to leave? When you shout BYE, she could
# pretend not to hear you. Change your previous program so that you have to
# shout BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test your program: if you shout
# BYE three times but not in a row, you should still be talking to Grandma.

I had to make some choice stylistically with the "" and '' I hope it doesn't
appear too inconsistent.
I'm also not sure if the bye_int is the best way to resolve the 3-in-a-row
problem as it (again) appears to violate the DRY rule. But hell, it works.
