# Write a program that prints out the lyrics to that beloved classic,
# "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall." Here's what the output should look like:
#
# 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer!
# Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall!
# 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer!
# Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall!
# ...
# 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer!
# Take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall!
# 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer!
# Take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall!
# "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."

# This code feels like I'm violating the DRY rule.
# Yet still kind of awesome, yes?
# For the record, my style before adding your output above kept my lines,
# save line XX under 80 Characters. :)

  # Is there a cleaner way to code line 16 in two lines to keep under 80 characters?
